### Data Analysis with Python. How to start programming without being a computer scientist. (Spanish)

[Martina Kienberger](https://github.com/martinakienberger) - PhD student (University of Vienna) & Assistant Professor (University of Salamanca)

Although still not very common, the use of programming languages for data analysis in social science has many advantages and is not as difficult as it may seem. In this talk a philologist will give you a short introduction about Python, what you may use it for and how to get started.

### Natural Language Processing for Linguistic & Social Sciences (What? How? and Why?) (Spanish)

[Ana Valdivia](https://github.com/anavaldi) - PhD (University of Granada)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) models aim at "understanding" human language. Although this area is considered a subfield of computer science, it is interesting to open it to other disciplines such as philology, sociology, psycology, etc. in order to create more robust results collaborating with multidisciplinary teams.
